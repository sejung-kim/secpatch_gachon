// DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Waivers generated with --waiver-output

`verilator_config

// Below are suggested waivers. You have three options:
//   1. Fix the reason for the linter warning in the Verilog sources
//   2. Keep the waiver permanently if you are sure it is okay
//   3. Keep the waiver temporarily to suppress the output

// No waivers needed - great!
